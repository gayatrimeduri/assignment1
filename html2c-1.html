    <p>
        Carrots are grown by direct seed sowing in containers. <br>
        Sow seeds about 0.5 cm deep, and plant 2-3 seeds in each planting hole.<br>
         Firm the soil gently after covering the seeds and water them immediately. Seeds should germinate within 8-10 days.<br>
         Carrot is a winter season crop and if grown at 15°C to 20°C will develop a very good colour.<br>
         Carrot crop needs deep loose loamy soil and pH should be ranging from 6.0 to 7.0 for higher production. <br>
         You can easily grow this healthy vegetable in your kitchen garden, all you need is a little guidance as to when and how to grow it.
